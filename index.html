<!--                        <h4 class="u-text u-text-2">-->
                            I'm so thankful for the weekly sessions. I took up Python during the pandemic to learn a new skill and hopefully transition career. <br/>
                            Self-learning is always tough but even more so under lockdown. <br/>
                            The Zoom sessions are great way to learn from each other, network and support each other as we all have stories to share. <br/>
                            As the tech industry is so male-dominated it may be an intimidating prospect for a female newbie to enter on their own. <br/>
                            I was particularly drawn to LoC because it's much easier to survive the jungle if you have a tribe who can relate to you.  <br/>
                            I've been overwhelmed by the kindness and support LoC offers, they give up considerable time and energy to help us on our journeys.<br/>

                        <b>How we work</b>
                        Every week, multiple teams come together and work on either katas or applications of their own design. <br/>
                        While doing this, every member works on the code at the same time. <br/>
                        The role of the Driver (the person writing the code) is rotated through-out the session while the rest of the team perform the Navigator role.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <b>How often do I need to attend</b>
                        We suggest aiming for a ratio of 40 out of 52 weeks. Having consistent attendance helps the team but life happens.
                        We understand that you'll need to do other things on Wednesdays.
                        Also we recommend that if you have taken leave from work then you should take leave from the group too and enjoy your break.
                        <br/>

                        <b>I know nothing about TDD or Ensemble coding, can I still join? </b>
                        Definitely! We'll start right at the beginning.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <b>What do I need to know before attending?</b>
                        You'll need to know the basics of at least of one programming language before attending - that's it!
                        The basics include: Setting up a project, basic snytax, variables, primitive types, loops and functions
